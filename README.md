# Personal website (Cloud Resume Challenge)
Developing this website using various cloud services to learn the basics of cloud. 

Current setup as follows:

![cloud](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Valeron-T/personal-website/main/web/assets/cloud.png)

Upcoming changes:
- ~~Create a CI pipeline to automatically push changes in git to azure blob storage.~~ 
- Create a IaC template to be able to migrate the entire azure deployment if required.
    - ~~Storage~~
    - Azure Functions
    - CDN

Depending on service cost, would consider other hosting options for long term.
